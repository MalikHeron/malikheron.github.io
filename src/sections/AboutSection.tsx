         <p className='description'>
            As a passionate problem-solver, I thrive on the challenge of
            crafting efficient and functional code. My goal is to create a
            seamless user experience through modern and visually
            appealing UI design.
            <br /><br />
            With experience in a variety of languages and tools, I am always
            looking for new ways to work smarter and more efficiently. 
            I am currently focused on mobile and web development, while
            continuously expanding my knowledge in UX and UI design. 
            <br /><br />
            I believe that having a strong understanding of user experience
            and user interface design is crucial in creating successful and
            user-friendly applications.
